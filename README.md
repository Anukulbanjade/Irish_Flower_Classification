# Irish Flower Classification Project

## Overview
Welcome to my Irish Flower Classification project repository! This project is part of my journey into data analytics and machine learning, where I worked on the task of classifying Irish flowers based on their features. The goal was to gain hands-on experience with various machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing techniques, and model evaluation methods.

## Project Description
In this project, I tackled the well-known Irish Flower Classification challenge, which involves identifying different species of flowers using their unique attributes. The dataset contains a variety of features such as petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width.

## Project Goals
- Gain practical experience in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection.
- Explore different machine learning algorithms including decision trees, random forests, and neural networks.
- Develop skills in evaluating model performance using accuracy and other relevant metrics.
- Showcase the ability to communicate results and insights effectively.
